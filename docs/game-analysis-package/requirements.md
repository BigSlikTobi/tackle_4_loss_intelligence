# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Game Analysis Package feature creates enriched, LLM-ready data packages from raw play-by-play game data. It identifies relevant players, fetches comprehensive stats from multiple sources, and produces both detailed datasets and compact analysis envelopes optimized for AI consumption. This feature follows the function-based isolation architecture, creating a new independent module that integrates with existing data loading capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to submit a play-by-play game package and receive an enriched analysis package, so that I can perform comprehensive game analysis with all relevant player and team data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid game package (season, week, game_id) is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate the package structure and completeness
2. WHEN the package is incomplete or malformed THEN the system SHALL return a descriptive error message identifying the specific game and request issues
3. WHEN the package is valid THEN the system SHALL proceed to player extraction and analysis

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the system to automatically identify relevant players from play-by-play data, so that I don't have to manually specify which players to include in the analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing play-by-play data THEN the system SHALL extract all unique player IDs from every play action (rusher, receiver, passer, returner, tackler, etc.)
2. WHEN calculating player relevance THEN the system SHALL compute impact signals including play frequency, production metrics (yards, TDs), and high-leverage events (sacks, turnovers, explosive plays)
3. WHEN selecting relevant players THEN the system SHALL maintain a balanced set with top 5 players per team, all quarterbacks with significant attempts, and any player who scored
4. WHEN ranking players THEN the system SHALL use a single relevance score combining all impact signals

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the feature to efficiently fetch data from multiple upstream sources in a single request, so that I can minimize API calls and improve performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building data requests THEN the system SHALL create a single combined request for all required data sources
2. WHEN requesting data THEN the system SHALL include full game play-by-play, team snap counts for both teams, contextual team information, and position-appropriate Next Gen Stats for selected players
3. WHEN managing payload size THEN the system SHALL inline critical per-player NGS data and use pointers/links for supplementary datasets
4. WHEN fetching data THEN the system SHALL send the combined request upstream and collect all responses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a downstream consumer, I want clean, normalized data with consistent identifiers, so that I can reliably join and analyze the information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing fetched data THEN the system SHALL replace invalid JSON values (like "NaN") with standard nulls
2. WHEN structuring data THEN the system SHALL use consistent identifiers keyed by game (season, week, game_id), teams (home/away abbreviations), and players (unique player ID)
3. WHEN recording data provenance THEN the system SHALL include source, version, and retrieval time for each data element
4. WHEN merging data THEN the system SHALL create one coherent structure combining all data sources

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want computed summaries for teams and players, so that I can quickly understand key performance metrics without manual calculation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN computing team summaries THEN the system SHALL calculate total plays, total yards, yards per play, and success indicators for each team
2. WHEN computing player summaries THEN the system SHALL calculate plays involved, touches, yards, TDs, notable events, and relevance scores for each selected player
3. WHEN generating summaries THEN the system SHALL ensure all calculations are accurate and consistent with the underlying play-by-play data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an AI system consumer, I want a compact, LLM-friendly analysis envelope, so that I can efficiently process game data for automated analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the analysis envelope THEN the system SHALL include game header (teams, date, location), team summaries (one line each), and player map (ID to name, position, team, compact stats)
2. WHEN structuring key sequences THEN the system SHALL provide short labeled moments with references to underlying plays
3. WHEN managing envelope size THEN the system SHALL keep the package small enough for direct AI ingestion while maintaining analytical richness
4. WHEN linking to detailed data THEN the system SHALL provide pointers/links to comprehensive datasets kept outside the envelope

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the feature to return both enriched packages and analysis envelopes with proper correlation IDs, so that I can trace and monitor the complete data flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN completing processing THEN the system SHALL return both the enriched package (full merged data with pointers) and the analysis envelope (compact LLM-ready format)
2. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL include correlation IDs using the game/package ID for traceability
3. WHEN integrating with n8n workflows THEN the system SHALL provide clean logging and flow tracking capabilities

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want this feature implemented as an independent module following function-based isolation principles, so that it can be developed, deployed, and maintained separately from other system components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the module THEN the system SHALL create a new independent module in `src/functions/game_analysis_package/`
2. WHEN structuring the module THEN the system SHALL follow the standard module structure with `core/`, `scripts/`, `functions/`, `requirements.txt`, `.env.example`, and `README.md`
3. WHEN integrating with existing modules THEN the system SHALL only use shared utilities from `src/shared/` and avoid direct imports from other function modules
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL support independent deployment as a Cloud Function without affecting other modules
