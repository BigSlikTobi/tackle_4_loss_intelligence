# Batch Processing Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented OpenAI Batch API integration for knowledge extraction, enabling **50% cost savings** for processing large volumes of story groups.

## Files Created

### 1. Core Batch Processing Modules

**`src/functions/knowledge_extraction/core/batch/`**
- `__init__.py` - Module exports

- `result_processor.py` - Processes batch output and writes to database

**`src/functions/knowledge_extraction/core/pipelines/`**
- `batch_pipeline.py` - Orchestrates complete batch workflow

### 2. Updated Files

**`scripts/extract_knowledge_cli.py`**
- Added `--batch` flag for batch processing
- Added `--wait` flag to wait for completion
- Added `--batch-status BATCH_ID` to check status
- Added `--batch-process BATCH_ID` to process results
- Added `--batch-list` to list recent batches
- Added `--batch-cancel BATCH_ID` to cancel batches

**`README.md`**
- Added batch processing documentation
- Added cost comparison examples
- Added complete workflow example
- Added architecture diagrams

## Key Features

### Cost Savings
- **50% discount** via OpenAI Batch API
- Example: 3,500 groups costs $17-35 (vs $35-70 synchronous)

### Scalability
- Process up to **50,000 groups per batch**
- Maximum 200MB input file size
- Automatic request batching (2 requests per group: topics + entities)

### Reliability
- 24-hour completion guarantee
- Automatic retries by OpenAI
- Progress tracking and monitoring
- Error handling and reporting

### Workflow

1. **Generate requests** - Create .jsonl file with extraction requests
2. **Upload to OpenAI** - Upload via Files API
3. **Create batch** - Submit batch job (status: validating → in_progress)
4. **Monitor progress** - Check status periodically
5. **Download results** - Fetch output file when completed
6. **Process results** - Parse responses and write to database

## Usage Examples

### Quick Start (Batch Processing)

```bash
# Process all unextracted groups (recommended for 3,500 groups)
python scripts/extract_knowledge_cli.py --batch

# Check status
python scripts/extract_knowledge_cli.py --batch-status batch_abc123

# Process results when complete
python scripts/extract_knowledge_cli.py --batch-process batch_abc123
```

### With Auto-Completion

```bash
# Create batch and wait for completion (auto-processes when done)
python scripts/extract_knowledge_cli.py --batch --wait
```

### Monitoring

```bash
# List recent batches
python scripts/extract_knowledge_cli.py --batch-list

# Check specific batch status
python scripts/extract_knowledge_cli.py --batch-status batch_abc123

# Cancel running batch
python scripts/extract_knowledge_cli.py --batch-cancel batch_abc123
```

## Architecture

### Request Generation
- Loads unextracted story groups from database
- Generates 2 requests per group:
  - Topic extraction: `/v1/responses` with topic prompt
  - Entity extraction: `/v1/responses` with entity prompt
- Saves to timestamped .jsonl file with metadata

### Batch Pipeline
- Uploads file to OpenAI Files API
- Creates batch job via Batches API
- Monitors status (validating → in_progress → completed)
- Downloads output file when ready
- Saves batch info locally for tracking

### Result Processing
- Parses .jsonl output file
- Groups results by story_group_id
- Extracts topics and entities from LLM responses
- Resolves entities to database IDs (fuzzy matching)
- Writes to `story_topics` and `story_entities` tables

## Technical Details

### File Format
```jsonl
{"custom_id": "topic_abc-123", "method": "POST", "url": "/v1/responses", "body": {...}}
{"custom_id": "entity_abc-123", "method": "POST", "url": "/v1/responses", "body": {...}}
```

### Output Format
```jsonl
{"id": "batch_req_123", "custom_id": "topic_abc-123", "response": {"status_code": 200, "body": {"output_text": "..."}}}
{"id": "batch_req_456", "custom_id": "entity_abc-123", "response": {"status_code": 200, "body": {"output_text": "..."}}}
```

### Batch Metadata
```json
{
  "batch_id": "batch_xyz789",
  "status": "completed",
  "total_groups": 3500,
  "total_requests": 7000,
  "input_file_path": "./batch_files/knowledge_extraction_batch_20251005_143022.jsonl",
  "metadata": {...}
}
```

## Benefits for Your Use Case

### For 3,500 Story Groups:

**Cost:**
- Synchronous: $35-70
- **Batch: $17-35** ✅ (50% savings)

**Time:**
- Synchronous: 2-4 hours (active monitoring needed)
- **Batch: 12-24 hours** (hands-off)

**Throughput:**
- Synchronous: ~15-30 groups/minute (rate-limited)
- **Batch: Up to 50,000 groups** (no rate limits)

**Reliability:**
- Synchronous: Requires error handling, retry logic
- **Batch: Automatic retries by OpenAI** ✅

## Recommendation

For your 3,500 story groups, I **strongly recommend batch processing**:

```bash
# One command does it all (with auto-wait)
python scripts/extract_knowledge_cli.py --batch --wait

# Or if you prefer to check back later
python scripts/extract_knowledge_cli.py --batch
# ... do other work ...
# Check status after a few hours
python scripts/extract_knowledge_cli.py --batch-status batch_abc123
# When complete:
python scripts/extract_knowledge_cli.py --batch-process batch_abc123
```

This will:
- ✅ Save you $18-35 compared to synchronous processing
- ✅ Process all 3,500 groups reliably
- ✅ Require minimal monitoring (just check status occasionally)
- ✅ Complete within 24 hours guaranteed

## Testing

Before running on all 3,500 groups, test with a small batch:

```bash
# Test with 10 groups first
python scripts/extract_knowledge_cli.py --batch --limit 10 --wait

# Verify results
python scripts/extract_knowledge_cli.py --progress
```

Once verified, scale to full dataset:

```bash
python scripts/extract_knowledge_cli.py --batch --wait
```
