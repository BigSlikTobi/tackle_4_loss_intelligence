    "No one expected Daniel Jones to be spearheading the NFL's No. 1 offense in total points and No. 2 unit in total yards. But that's exactly how the 2025 NFL season has played out after seven weeks with the Colts averaging 33.1 points on 380.3 yards per game. The Colts are the largest favorite in the Week 8 NFL schedule, favored by 14.5 points against the Titans, and the SportsLine Machine Learning Model expects Jones and the Indianapolis offense to continue its dominance this weekend. The model has identified Jones Over 233.5 passing yards as one of its best bets for Week 8 NFL player props for NFL betting . Jones is averaging 255.7 passing yards per game in his first season in Indy, heading into a 4:25 p.m. ET matchup against the Titans.",
    "Along with backing Jones, the model also likes Saints running back Alvin Kamara Over 43.5 rushing yards and Falcons wide receiver Drake London Over 63.5 receiving yards among its Week 8 NFL player props best bets for online sports betting . Backup Saints running back Kendre Miller tore his ACL last week, and the model expects that to lead to more opportunities and production for Kamara to hit his Over for Week 8 NFL props.",

    "Jones is fifth in the NFL in passing yards (1,790) while averaging a career-high 255.7 passing yards per game in his seventh NFL season and first year in Indianapolis. He had 288 passing yards and two touchdowns in a 38-24 win over the Chargers last week, and he's gone Over this total in four of seven games this season. He's thrown for more than 210 yards in all seven games this season, so he's never been far off reaching 234 passing yards. Jones threw for 228 yards on just 25 pass attempts, his fewest attempts of the season, in a 41-20 win over the Titans in Week 3. Although the Colts are 14.5-point favorites, the Titans could come out with a better offensive performance following the firing of head coach Brian Callahan, making the game competitive for longer and giving Jones more opportunities to pass. The model projects Jones for 263 passing yards on Sunday.",

    "Kamara has gone Under this number in three straight games, but the 30-year-old went Over it in three of his first four games and had at least 42 rushing yards in each of his first four contests, and given the recent New Orleans backfield injury, Kamara could be in line for an even heavier workload. Backup running back Kendre Miller tore his ACL last week on just his second snap after three straight weeks of playing at least 30% of snaps. Miller was just starting to receive more opportunities with back-to-back games of playing on 39% of snaps after playing just 15% in each of the first two games of the season. Given Kamara's likely uptick in usage and a home matchup against Tampa Bay, the model projects 58 rushing yards for the veteran running back on Sunday.",

    "After back-to-back games with at least 110 yards, London was held to just 42 receiving yards last week. But his usage signaled someone who should have had a much stronger game, with London generating 10 targets, reaching double-digit targets for the fourth time this season. He only had four receptions, though, but with three straight games of at least 10 targets, the Falcons are clearly making it a priority to feature him in the offense. The fourth-year receiver is averaging a career-high 78.2 yards per game, as he's increased his per-game averages in each of his first four NFL seasons. The Falcons play the Dolphins, who are 29th in scoring defense (29.3 ppg allowed) and 26th in yards allowed (363.1 per game). Miami is allowing the highest completion percentage against (74.61%), so if the double-digit target trend continues, he'll likely secure far more than four receptions on Sunday, giving him a strong chance at hitting the Over.",
