# Task 5.1 & 5.2 Implementation: Data Normalization and Merging

**Date**: 2025-10-14  
**Status**: ✅ Complete and Tested

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive data normalization and merging services for the game analysis pipeline:

- **Task 5.1**: Data normalization service to clean and standardize fetched data
- **Task 5.2**: Data merging logic to create coherent enriched packages

## Implementation Summary

### Task 5.1: Data Normalization ✅

**File**: `core/processing/data_normalizer.py` (432 lines)

**Purpose**: Clean and standardize data from upstream providers to ensure consistent, valid JSON output.

**Key Features**:
1. **Invalid JSON Value Handling**:
   - Replaces `NaN` with `None` (Python's JSON serialization)
   - Replaces `Infinity` and `-Infinity` with `None`
   - Converts `"null"` strings to `None`
   - Handles empty strings in ID fields

2. **Recursive Normalization**:
   - Processes nested dictionaries recursively
   - Processes lists recursively
   - Maintains data structure integrity

3. **ID Field Detection**:
   - Identifies ID fields by name patterns
   - Converts empty ID strings to `None`
   - Preserves valid ID formats

4. **Provenance Tracking**:
   - Carries forward source metadata
   - Tracks normalization timestamp
   - Records issues found and fixed
   - Counts records processed per source

5. **Source-Specific Normalization**:
   - `_normalize_play_by_play()`: PBP records
   - `_normalize_snap_counts()`: Snap count records
   - `_normalize_team_context()`: Team statistics
   - `_normalize_ngs_data()`: NGS stats by type

**Example Usage**:
```python
from core.processing import DataNormalizer

normalizer = DataNormalizer()
normalized = normalizer.normalize(fetch_result)

# Access cleaned data
clean_pbp = normalized.play_by_play
clean_ngs = normalized.ngs_data["passing"]

# Check normalization results
print(f"Processed: {normalized.records_processed}")
print(f"Issues fixed: {len(normalized.issues_found)}")
```

### Task 5.2: Data Merging ✅

**File**: `core/processing/data_merger.py` (497 lines)

**Purpose**: Merge normalized data with game package to create coherent enriched structure.

**Key Features**:
1. **Hierarchical Organization**:
   - Game level: season, week, game_id
   - Team level: keyed by team abbreviation
   - Player level: keyed by player_id

2. **Data Preservation**:
   - Preserves original play data from package
   - Adds enrichment data separately
   - Maintains data lineage

3. **Player Data Initialization**:
   - Extracts all player IDs from plays
   - Initializes entry for each player
   - Merges enrichment data by player_id

4. **NGS Data Integration**:
   - Organizes by stat type (passing/rushing/receiving)
   - Keys by `player_gsis_id` or `player_id`
   - Stores under `ngs_stats` in player data

5. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Last-write-wins strategy
   - Logs all conflicts for debugging
   - Tracks conflicts in metadata

6. **Enrichment Tracking**:
   - Counts players enriched
   - Counts teams enriched
   - Tracks conflicts resolved

**Example Usage**:
```python
from core.processing import DataMerger

merger = DataMerger()
merged = merger.merge(game_package, normalized_data)

# Access organized data
player_stats = merged.player_data["00-0036322"]
team_stats = merged.team_data["SF"]

# Check merge results
print(f"Players enriched: {merged.players_enriched}")
print(f"Teams enriched: {merged.teams_enriched}")
```

## Data Structures

### NormalizedData

```python
@dataclass
class NormalizedData:
    # Normalized data by source
    play_by_play: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]]
    snap_counts: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]]
    team_context: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
    ngs_data: Dict[str, List[Dict[str, Any]]]  # keyed by stat_type
    
    # Normalization metadata
    normalization_timestamp: Optional[float]
    records_processed: Dict[str, int]
    issues_found: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    
    # Provenance (carried forward)
    provenance: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]
```

### MergedData

```python
@dataclass
class MergedData:
    # Core game information
    season: int
    week: int
    game_id: str
    
    # Original plays from package
    plays: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    
    # Organized enrichment data
    team_data: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]        # keyed by team_abbr
    player_data: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]      # keyed by player_id
    
    # Additional data

    teams_enriched: int
    conflicts_resolved: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    
    # Provenance
    data_sources: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]
```

## Pipeline Integration

### Updated CLI (analyze_game_cli.py)

Added Steps 6 and 7 to the analysis pipeline:

```python
# Step 6: Normalize data (if fetched)
if fetch_result:
    logger.info("Step 6: Normalizing fetched data...")
    normalizer = DataNormalizer()
    normalized_data = normalizer.normalize(fetch_result)
    logger.info(f"✓ Normalized {sum(normalized_data.records_processed.values())} records")

# Step 7: Merge data into enriched package (if normalized)
if normalized_data:
    logger.info("Step 7: Merging data into enriched package...")
    merger = DataMerger()
    merged_data = merger.merge(package, normalized_data)
    logger.info(f"✓ Merged data: {merged_data.players_enriched} players enriched")
```

### Result Structure Enhancement

Added normalization and merge results to CLI output:

```json

    "records_processed": {
      "play_by_play": 0,
      "ngs_passing": 1,

**Sample Player Data**:
```json
{
  "00-0033873": {
    "ngs_stats": {
      "passing": {
        "completions": 16,
        "attempts": 28,

    }
  }
}
```

## Edge Cases Handled

### Normalization Edge Cases
1. **NaN values**: Replaced with None for JSON compatibility
2. **Infinity values**: Replaced with None
3. **Empty ID strings**: Converted to None
4. **"null" strings**: Converted to None
5. **Nested structures**: Processed recursively
6. **Mixed data types**: Preserved correctly
7. **None values**: Passed through unchanged

### Merging Edge Cases
1. **No enrichment data**: Returns base structure with empty enrichments
2. **Missing player IDs**: Skipped with warning logged
3. **Duplicate player IDs**: Handled correctly (no duplicates)
4. **Mixed stat types**: Organized under `ngs_stats` by type
5. **Empty plays list**: Handled gracefully
6. **Missing game info**: Extracted from package

## Performance Characteristics

### Normalization
- **Time complexity**: O(n) where n = total records
- **Space complexity**: O(n) for normalized output
- **Recursive depth**: Handles arbitrary nesting
- **Memory efficient**: Processes records sequentially

### Merging
- **Time complexity**: O(p + r) where p = plays, r = enrichment records
- **Space complexity**: O(p + u) where u = unique players
- **Index creation**: O(1) lookups for player/team data
- **Minimal copying**: Preserves references where possible

## Known Limitations

### Normalization
1. **ID Standardization**: Currently preserves IDs as-is; future enhancement could add cross-referencing
2. **Data Validation**: Focuses on JSON compatibility; doesn't validate business rules
3. **Type Coercion**: Minimal type conversion; preserves original types

### Merging
1. **Conflict Resolution**: Simple last-write-wins; could add more sophisticated strategies
2. **Team Context**: Currently limited; needs enhancement when team data available
3. **Play Enrichment**: PBP enrichment keyed by play_id; assumes unique play IDs

## Future Enhancements

### Normalization
- [ ] Cross-reference player IDs across systems (gsis ↔ pfr ↔ nflverse)
- [ ] Add data validation beyond JSON compatibility
- [ ] Implement configurable normalization rules
- [ ] Add support for custom transformations per source

### Merging
- [ ] Implement priority-based conflict resolution
- [ ] Add merge strategies (union, intersection, etc.)
- [ ] Enhance team data integration
- [ ] Add play-level enrichment indexing
- [ ] Support partial updates and incremental merging
