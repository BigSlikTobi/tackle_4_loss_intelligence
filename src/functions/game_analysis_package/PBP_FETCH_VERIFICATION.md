# Play-by-Play Fetching Verification

**Date**: 2025-01-14  
**Status**: ✅ **CONFIRMED WORKING**

## Summary

The play-by-play (PBP) data fetching is **fully functional** and working as expected. The initial test with `sample_game.json` returned 0 records because the test game ID doesn't exist in the actual NFL dataset, **not** because of a bug in the fetching logic.

## Test Results

### Test 1: Fictional Game (sample_game.json)
**Game ID**: `2024_05_SF_KC` (2024 Season, Week 5)  
**Result**: 0 play-by-play records  
**Reason**: This game doesn't exist in the NFL dataset (either hasn't occurred yet or week 5 2024 data not available)

### Test 2: Real Game (real_game.json)
**Game ID**: `2023_01_DET_KC` (2023 Season, Week 1 - Detroit @ Kansas City)  
**Result**: **179 play-by-play records** ✅  
**Fetched Data**:
```json
{
  "play_by_play": 179,
  "snap_counts": 0,
  "team_context": 0,
  "ngs_data": {
    "receiving": 0,
    "rushing": 0,
    "passing": 1
  }
}
```

## How PBP Fetching Works

1. **Provider**: Uses `PlayByPlayProvider` from data_loading module
2. **Fetch Strategy**: 
   - Calls `nflreadpy.load_pbp(season, week)` to get all plays for that week
   - Filters results by `game_id` to get plays for specific game
3. **Data Source**: nfl_data_py / nflverse
4. **Performance**: ~24 seconds for week 5 fetch, then instant filter

## Key Implementation Details

**DataFetcher._fetch_play_by_play()**:
```python
provider = self._get_provider("pbp")
data = provider.get(
    season=request.season,
    week=request.week,
    game_id=request.game_id,
    output="dict"
)
```

**Provider Requirements**:
- `game_id` (required): Game identifier in format `YYYY_WW_AWAY_HOME`
- `season` (derived from game_id or explicit)
- `week` (derived from game_id or explicit)

**Improved Logging**:
```python
if data:
    logger.info(f"✓ Fetched {len(data)} play-by-play records")
else:
    logger.warning(f"✓ No records found for {game_id} (game may not exist in dataset)")
```

## Verification Commands

### Test with Fictional Game
```bash
python scripts/analyze_game_cli.py \
  --request test_requests/sample_game.json \
  --fetch

# Expected: 0 PBP records (game doesn't exist)
```

### Test with Real Game  
```bash
python scripts/analyze_game_cli.py \
  --request test_requests/real_game.json \
  --fetch --pretty

# Expected: 179 PBP records ✅
```

### Direct Provider Test
```python
from src.functions.data_loading.core.providers import get_provider

provider = get_provider('pbp')
data = provider.get(
    season=2023, 
    week=1, 
    game_id='2023_01_DET_KC', 
    output='dict'
)

print(f'Fetched {len(data)} plays')  # Output: Fetched 179 plays
```

## Test Files

### real_game.json
- **Purpose**: Test with actual NFL game that exists in dataset
- **Game**: 2023 Week 1, DET @ KC
- **Expected**: 179 PBP records from real game
- **Use Case**: Verify full data fetching pipeline

### sample_game.json
- **Purpose**: Test with minimal fictional game data
- **Game**: 2024 Week 5, SF @ KC (doesn't exist)
- **Expected**: 0 PBP records, but no errors
- **Use Case**: Verify error handling for missing games

## Conclusion

✅ **PBP fetching is fully functional**  
✅ **Gracefully handles missing games** (returns empty, not error)  
✅ **Successfully fetches real game data** (179 records for 2023_01_DET_KC)  
✅ **Proper logging and provenance tracking**  
✅ **Integration with existing data_loading providers working**

The initial confusion was due to using a test game ID that doesn't exist in the NFL dataset. When tested with a real game (`2023_01_DET_KC`), the fetcher successfully retrieved 179 plays, confirming that the implementation is correct.

**No changes needed** - the implementation is working as designed.
