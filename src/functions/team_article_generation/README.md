# Team Article Generation Module

This module establishes the foundation for synthesizing multi-source article summaries into cohesive daily team updates using OpenAI GPT-5. The scaffold fulfills Task 5 of the Daily Team Update Pipeline plan and adheres to the function-based isolation rules in the repository.

## Responsibilities
- Accept multiple article summaries for a single team
- Construct structured GPT-5 prompts geared toward a single narrative
- Validate generated articles for completeness and factual alignment with source summaries
- Emit normalized outputs with headline, sub-header, introduction, and content sections

## Project Layout
```
core/
  contracts/     # Data models for generation inputs/outputs
  llm/           # GPT-5 client abstractions and prompt builders
  processors/    # Narrative analysis and validation helpers
functions/       # Cloud Function adapters (stub)
scripts/         # CLI tooling for manual article generation
requirements.txt # Module-specific dependencies
```

## Configuration
Configuration is centrally managed through the repository-level `.env`. Future work in this module will load and validate required variables using shared utilities.

## Next Steps
- Define data contracts representing summarization bundles and article outputs
- Implement GPT-5 flex-mode client and prompt composition helpers
- Add validation routines that ensure narrative focus and schema compliance
- Develop a CLI entry point to experiment with article generation locally
