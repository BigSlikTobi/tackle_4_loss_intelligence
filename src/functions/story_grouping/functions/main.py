"""
Placeholder for Cloud Function deployment.

This file will contain the Cloud Function entry point for story grouping.
Currently, the module is CLI-only. See scripts/group_stories_cli.py for usage.

Future implementation will include:
- HTTP endpoint for triggering grouping on demand
- Event-driven grouping when new embeddings are created
- Scheduled grouping via Cloud Scheduler
